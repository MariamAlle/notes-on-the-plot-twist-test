            <p class="intro-paragraph">I’m standing here, at the quiet close of a chapter that has defined nearly four years of my life. It’s an ending that feels like the last, soft chord of a beautiful, extended song.

                <p>This journey proved that great power isn't necessarily found in a crown, but in the miraculous, powerful wisdom woven into our anatomy—a truth I'll carry with me, long after the last feed has faded to a memory.</p>
